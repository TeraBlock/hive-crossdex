# README for TeraBlock Cross-Chain Swap (React Project) on Hive Blockchain

## Introduction

Welcome to the TeraBlock Cross-Chain Swap project for the Hive Blockchain. This is an open-source React application designed to facilitate seamless and efficient cross-chain transactions between the Hive blockchain and other supported blockchains. Our goal is to provide a decentralized, secure, and user-friendly swapping experience.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Swapping**: Facilitates asset swaps between Hive and other supported blockchains.
- **Decentralized Application**: Run the application independently at your end.
- **React-Based UI**: A modern, responsive user interface built with React.
- **Secure and Private**: Enhanced security features with a focus on user privacy.
- **Open Source**: Modify and adapt the code to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript.
- A Hive blockchain account and compatible wallets for other supported blockchains.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/terablock/hive-crossdex.git]
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
   ```bash
   cd cross-chain-swap
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the React App**: 
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

2. **Build for Production**: 
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Usage

- **Connect Your Wallets**: Use the interface to connect your Hive wallet and other blockchain wallets.
- **Perform Swaps**: Select the source and destination chains, enter the amount, and initiate the swap.
- **Monitor Transactions**: Keep track of your transactions directly through the application.
